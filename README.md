## Instructions

This is a landing project which include HTML CSS to display a static landing page.You'll need javascript to conert this static project intointeractive one .

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building app.

For specific,instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Index
This file only consist a skeleton landing page . within the header you will find the the navigation bar. Within the body, there are four sections that are added to begin with. Right now, there is simply filler text here but this can be easily fixed in the future. Note the `id`, `class`, and `data-nav` variables and how they are used. This will come into play later on when we create an interactive site.

## App
Here is where the functionality happens. There is three things that this fileachieves. The first is dynamically build navigation bar. We loop through the number of implemented sections and generate an area in the header for each one. Next is allowing the header to show which section is currently "active" in the page. Finally, this file listen click , when we click on it , it comes to the particulaar section.

## Styles
Most of the code here was taken from the skelton code provided by Udacity. This gives the landing page the look and feel that you see and experience. One notable thing is the hover animation on the active navigation header.

## Running
To launch this website, open the `index.html` file in the browser.
